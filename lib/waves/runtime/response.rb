module Waves

  # Waves::Response represents an HTTP response and has methods for constructing a response.
  # These include setters for +content_type+, +content_length+, +location+, and +expires+
  # headers. You may also set the headers directly using the [] operator. 
  # See Rack::Response for documentation of any method not defined here.
